# VideoCrasherChecker
VCC is an automated software that will check whether a discord video will likely lead to a discord crash.

## Infos
- To use it just download the video and drag it on the executable

- For now it only supports `.MP4` files
  - âš To test it on other files, ex: `.MOV` you could try changing the extension to `.MP4` although I don't recommend doing.
- It does a basic sig scanning for a 8+ bytes skip over box in the mp4 file format
